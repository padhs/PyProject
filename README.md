# PyProject
Implemented the IRIS data set from kaggle.com ----> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset/data

Included the csv file her in the project directory as well

used this code ---> https://www.kaggle.com/code/arosekp/dbscan-iris-dataset/edit for DBScan clustering

Plots showing correlation with each of other parameters (Each measured data is correlated with other data set points)

Training Models Used:

Logistic Regression
KNearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forest
Decision Tree

Accuracy plot of each of these showed Logistic Regression and KNN models with the highest accuracy.
